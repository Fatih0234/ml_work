# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This repository contains Python code to explore the concepts of linear regression and gradient descent. It's designed to help beginners understand how supervised learning works and experiment with key components like loss functions, learning rate, and optimization.

## Features

- **Data Generation**: Creates a synthetic dataset with a linear relationship and random noise.
- **Loss Functions**: Calculates L2 Loss (Mean Squared Error) and L1 Loss (Mean Absolute Error).
- **Gradient Descent**: Optimizes the weight and bias parameters to minimize the loss function.
- **Visualization**: 
  - Scatter plot of the data.
  - Loss reduction over epochs.
  - Fitted line after optimization.
